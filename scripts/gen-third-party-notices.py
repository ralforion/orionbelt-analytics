"""Generate ``THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`` from the resolved production tree.

OrionBelt Analytics itself is BUSL-1.1. The PyPI wheel only *declares* its
dependencies -- pip fetches them from PyPI, so nothing third-party is
redistributed there and no attribution is owed. The Docker image is different:
it bakes in the whole ``uv sync --no-dev`` closure plus a Debian base, which is
redistribution of binaries, and MIT/BSD/Apache-2.0 all require the copyright
notice and licence text to travel with them.

This script produces the notice file that satisfies that, and the CI ``--check``
mode keeps it honest when Dependabot moves the tree underneath us.

Two deliberate design choices, both about keeping the committed file stable:

1. **No versions, and PyPI URLs rather than declared home pages.** A notice
   owes attribution, not a version number, and a declared ``Home-page`` drifts
   between releases. Deriving every row from the package *name* alone means a
   routine version bump produces no diff at all, so the ``--check`` gate stays
   quiet until the thing worth a human look actually happens: a package
   entering or leaving the tree, or changing licence. Red CI on every bump
   would train everyone to regenerate without reading.

2. **No verbatim licence texts in the Markdown.** Inlined and deduplicated they
   run to ~810 KB, they trip ``check-added-large-files``, and -- worse -- they
   are not reproducible: numpy and friends ship different vendored-library
   texts per platform wheel, so a macOS dev and Linux CI would generate
   different files forever. The texts belong with the binaries instead. They
   already ship inside the image under each ``*.dist-info/``; ``--dump-texts``
   collects them into one file at Docker build time so that stays true by
   construction rather than by accident.

Usage::

    python scripts/gen-third-party-notices.py            # write the file
    python scripts/gen-third-party-notices.py --check    # fail if stale (CI)
    python scripts/gen-third-party-notices.py --dump-texts OUT  # image bundle
