# Development Guide

[<- Back to README](../README.md)

This guide covers the development workflow for OrionBelt® Analytics -- prerequisites, project layout, architecture, testing, and contribution guidelines.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13 or higher** -- required by the project and enforced in `pyproject.toml`
- **uv** package manager -- handles virtual environment creation, dependency resolution, and script execution in a single tool. Install from [github.com/astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- **Git** -- for version control and conventional commit workflow

Optional but recommended:

- **pre-commit** -- runs formatting and linting checks before each commit (installed as a dev dependency)

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ralforion/orionbelt-analytics
cd orionbelt-analytics
uv sync
```

`uv sync` creates a virtual environment with Python 3.13, installs all production and dev dependencies, and locks the versions.

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit `.env` with your database credentials and server settings. Key variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | `http` | Transport mode (`http` or `sse`) |
| `MCP_SERVER_HOST` | `localhost` | Server bind address |
| `MCP_SERVER_PORT` | `9000` | Server port |
| `ONTOLOGY_BASE_URI` | `http://example.com/ontology/` | RDF namespace base |
| `R2RML_BASE_IRI` | `http://mycompany.com/` | R2RML mapping IRI |
| `OUTPUT_DIR` | `tmp` | Directory for generated files |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging verbosity |
| `AUTO_GRAPHRAG` | `true` | Auto-initialize GraphRAG on schema analysis |
| `SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `1800` | Idle session eviction (0 to disable) |

Database-specific variables (`POSTGRES_*`, `SNOWFLAKE_*`, `CLICKHOUSE_*`, `DREMIO_*`, `BIGQUERY_*`, `DUCKDB_*`, `DATABRICKS_*`, `MYSQL_*`) are documented in `.env.template` and in [docs/configuration.md](configuration.md).

### 3. Start the server

```bash
uv run server.py
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:9000` by default, using streamable HTTP transport.

---

## Running Tests

Tests use **pytest** with `asyncio_mode = "auto"` and automatic coverage reporting. Configuration lives in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`.

```bash
# Run the full test suite with coverage
uv run pytest

# Run a single test file
uv run pytest tests/test_ontology_generator.py -v

# Run a specific test by name
uv run pytest tests/test_ontology_generator.py::test_function_name -v

# Run tests matching a keyword expression
uv run pytest -k "ontology and not server"

# Run with detailed coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run with HTML coverage output
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

Default `addopts` in `pyproject.toml` already includes `-ra -q --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing`, so a bare `uv run pytest` produces a coverage summary.

Test files follow the `test_*.py` convention in the `tests/` directory, covering ontology generation, database management, security, OBQC validation, GraphRAG integration, OWL axioms, Oxigraph persistence, session eviction, workspaces, and server tools.

---

## Code Quality

### Formatting

```bash
# Auto-format with black (line length 88, Python 3.13 target)
black src/ tests/ server.py

# Sort imports (configured for black compatibility)
isort src/ tests/ server.py
```

### Linting

```bash
# Ruff -- fast linter and formatter
ruff check src/ tests/ server.py

# Flake8
flake8 src/

# Find unused code
vulture src/
```

### Type checking

```bash
# mypy with strict mode (configured in pyproject.toml)
mypy src/
```

mypy is configured with `disallow_untyped_defs`, `disallow_incomplete_defs`, `warn_return_any`, `strict_equality`, and other strict options. All public functions require type hints.

### Security scanning

```bash
# Static security analysis (skips assert_used in tests)
bandit -r src/

# Dependency vulnerability scanning, against the tree that actually ships
./scripts/audit-prod-deps.sh
```

Dependabot security updates scan the whole of `uv.lock`, so its alert list is
wider than the shipped surface — it includes the dev group. `audit-prod-deps.sh`
is the narrower check: what a user installing the wheel is actually exposed to.
It runs in CI as the blocking `deps` job, so it is the same command locally and
on a pull request.

Advisories accepted as unreachable are listed at the top of that script, each
with the reason it cannot be triggered from this codebase. Adding an entry there
is a review decision, not a formality — it should mirror a Dependabot dismissal
and be removed as soon as a fixed release exists.

### Workflow action pins

Every `uses:` in `.github/workflows/` is pinned to a 40-character commit SHA
with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment naming the release it was cut from. That is why the
workflows are full of hex. A git tag is a movable label, so `actions/checkout@v7`
runs whatever commit that label points at when the job starts, and the owner of
the action can repoint it at any time. A SHA cannot move.

Pinning fixes *which* code runs, but it also makes every reference unreadable,
and nothing otherwise keeps a hash and the comment beside it in agreement. A
pull request could swap the hash for one taken from a fork -- reachable under
the real repository's URL, because forks share object storage with their parent
-- leave the comment saying `# v7.0.1`, and produce a diff that looks exactly
like a routine Dependabot bump. Only resolving the tag tells the two apart:

```bash
# Verify every pin: SHA present, owner allowed, comment names an exact patch
# release, and that release really is the commit pinned.
./scripts/check-action-pins.sh

# Same, minus the upstream `git ls-remote` lookups -- useful offline or when
# you only want the format checks.
./scripts/check-action-pins.sh --offline
```

The comment must name an exact patch release (`# v7.0.1`), never a major tag:
`v7` moves with every upstream release and would turn the check red for a pin
that is still perfectly good. Tags are resolved with `git ls-remote`, so the
check needs no token and is not rate limited. It fails closed -- a lookup that
could not be made at all is a failure, not a pass.

The script's `ALLOWED_OWNERS` list carries the most weight of its three checks,
because a SHA matching its own tag says nothing about whether the action
belongs here at all: `evil/action@<sha> # v1.0.0` verifies perfectly well
against evil's own tag. Adding an owner is a deliberate decision, not a
formality. The `pins` job in `ci.yml` runs the check on every pull request, and
both tag-publishing workflows run it as the first step after checkout, before
any other action -- an action that has already executed could have rewritten
the workspace, this script included.

What it does not do: it does not judge whether an action is safe (a pinned SHA
of a genuinely malicious release passes), it does not stop a downgrade to a
real but ancient release, and it says nothing about upstream being compromised.
`actions/checkout` runs before the check and is therefore unverified -- an
irreducible bootstrap dependency, since nothing can be checked before the tree
it fetches exists.

To resolve a SHA yourself when bumping an action:

```bash
git ls-remote https://github.com/actions/checkout 'refs/tags/v7.0.1^{}'
```

### Pre-commit hooks

```bash
# Install hooks (one-time setup)
pre-commit install

# Run all hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Pre-commit runs formatting, linting, and security checks automatically before each commit.

## Architecture

### Three-layer pattern

The codebase follows a strict three-layer separation:

```
server.py
  +-- src/main.py          (1) Registration layer -- @mcp.tool() async decorators
        +-- src/handlers/  (2) Handler layer     -- tool implementation logic
              +-- src/*.py  (3) Service layer     -- domain modules
```

**Registration layer** (`src/main.py`): Thin wrappers that define MCP tool signatures with `@mcp.tool()` decorators. Each wrapper extracts session state and delegates to the corresponding handler. No business logic lives here.

**Handler layer** (`src/handlers/*.py`): Contains the actual tool implementation. Handlers receive utilities (database manager, session data, configuration) as parameters and orchestrate calls to service-layer modules. Each file groups related tools:

- `connection.py` -- database connections
- `schema.py` -- schema analysis
- `ontology.py` -- ontology generation and semantic names
- `query.py` -- SQL validation and execution
- `chart.py` -- chart generation
- `rdf.py` -- SPARQL and RDF store operations
- `graphrag.py` -- GraphRAG initialization and context retrieval
- `info.py` -- server info

**Service layer** (`src/database_manager.py`, `src/ontology_generator.py`, etc.): Pure domain logic with no MCP dependencies. These modules are independently testable and handle database connectivity, RDF generation, security validation, and so on.

### Database driver pattern

An abstract base driver (`src/drivers/base.py`) defines the interface that each database implementation must satisfy. Per-database drivers handle dialect differences:

```
BaseDriver (src/drivers/base.py)
  |-- PostgreSQLDriver     Standard SQL, information_schema
  |-- MySQLDriver          MySQL-specific syntax, utf8mb4
  |-- SnowflakeDriver      UPPERCASE identifiers, case-sensitive quoting
  |-- ClickHouseDriver     No FKs, system.* tables, ORDER BY = sort key
  |-- DremioDriver         PostgreSQL wire protocol, path-based sources
  |-- BigQueryDriver       Project/dataset scoping, default credentials
  |-- DuckDBDriver         Local files, :memory:, MotherDuck cloud
  +-- DatabricksDriver     Unity Catalog, HTTP path, access tokens
```

Adding a new database requires implementing the `BaseDriver` interface and registering the driver in `database_manager.py`.

### Session state and what sessions share

State is split along one line: what the *database* is, and what a *user* is doing with it.

**Per user session** -- a `SessionData` instance (`src/session.py`):

- which connection the session is on, and its **connection handle** (`ob_k2m9qa`)
- the **current schema**
- **SchemaState** (per schema), which bundles:
  - **OntologyState** -- the active or custom-loaded ontology, file paths, applied semantic names, and the OBQC validator built from it
  - **schema_file** -- saved schema JSON reference
- **RDFStoreState** -- this session's reference to the connection's Oxigraph store

Two people on the same database may work with different ontologies. One of them loading their own with `load_my_ontology` never swaps the other's validator.

**Per database connection** -- a `ConnectionRuntime`, one per connection ID, that `ServerState` (`src/server_state.py`) binds sessions to and reference-counts:

- the **database manager** (it connects with the server's own credentials, not the client's)
- the **SchemaCache** -- tables, columns and keys as the database reports them
- **GraphRAGState** -- the GraphRAG manager, an index built from that schema; accumulative across schemas
- a **writer lock** that serializes the tools rewriting this state or the workspace on disk: `discover_schema`, `generate_ontology`, `apply_semantic_names`, `load_my_ontology`, `reset_cache`, `cleanup_workspace`, `cleanup_old_versions`, and the restore inside `connect_database`. It is taken in `main.py` (`async with _writer_lock(ctx):`); readers take none

The Oxigraph store is shared per store directory as well (RocksDB allows one handle per directory), through its own registry in `ServerState`. A second client on the same database therefore joins a warm cache, an open connection and a built index instead of rebuilding them, and the manager is disconnected when the last session leaves. Because the runtime is shared, never clear or reconnect it in place on behalf of one session: `connect_database` connects a fresh manager when the session already shares a runtime, and `_clear_session_state` unbinds before it clears.

Ontology state is isolated per schema via `SchemaState`. GraphRAG and the Oxigraph RDF store are connection-scoped: each `discover_schema()` call accumulates tables into the same graph and vector store, enabling cross-schema join path discovery and unified semantic search. Switching schemas (e.g., `discover_schema("analytics")` after `discover_schema("public")`) does not destroy the previous schema's ontology state, and both schemas' tables are searchable in GraphRAG simultaneously.

**Still shared on disk:** the workspace (generated ontology versions and the active version that `connect_database` restores), saved semantic models and the RDF store are stored per connection. A generated ontology becomes what the next connect restores, and an auto-persisted one replaces the schema's default named graph for everyone querying it.

**How a request finds its session** (`get_session_data(ctx)`): by the `connection` handle the call was made with, else by the MCP transport session, else as the only live session that was itself opened without a transport session (`SESSIONLESS_FALLBACK=none` disables that last rule; multi-user deployments should). The handle exists because MCP 2026-07-28 has no transport session; the `@_connection_aware()` decorator in `main.py` gives every tool the argument. The sessionless era is recognised by the request's protocol revision, not by a missing session ID, because FastMCP 4 reports a fresh `ctx.session_id` on every such request. Sessions, handles included, are evicted after `SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` of inactivity.

This is workflow isolation, not a security boundary: every client uses the server's database credentials, and a handle is an address, not a secret.

### Key design patterns

**Fan-trap prevention**: Multi-step validation pipeline that detects dangerous join patterns in SQL queries (1:many relationships with aggregation). The system suggests safe alternatives like UNION ALL or separate CTEs.

**Ontology triple storage**: RDF graphs embed SQL metadata using the `oba:` (OrionBelt Analytics) namespace. Tables become OWL classes with `oba:tableName` and `oba:primaryKey` annotations; relationships become OWL object properties with `oba:sqlJoinCondition`. The Oxigraph store provides persistent SPARQL 1.1 query access.

**GraphRAG auto-initialization**: When `discover_schema()` runs, GraphRAG is automatically initialized in the background (controlled by `AUTO_GRAPHRAG`). The graph structure supports up to 12-hop traversal for relationship discovery, and ChromaDB stores vector embeddings for semantic similarity search.

**MCP resources**: Skills stored in `.claude/skills/` (fan-trap prevention, SQL best practices, chart examples, analytical workflow) are exposed as MCP resources via `@mcp.resource()` decorators.

---

## Python Scripting

While OrionBelt Analytics is designed to run as an MCP server, advanced users can import its service-layer modules directly for batch processing or automation:

```python
from src.database_manager import DatabaseManager
from src.ontology_generator import OntologyGenerator

db = DatabaseManager()
db.connect_postgresql("localhost", 5432, "mydb", "user", "pass")
schema = db.get_schema_info("public")

generator = OntologyGenerator()
ontology_ttl = generator.generate_ontology(schema)
```

Service-layer modules (`database_manager`, `ontology_generator`, `security`, `oxigraph_store`, etc.) have no MCP dependencies and can be used independently. Handler-layer and registration-layer code depends on FastMCP and session state and is not intended for standalone use. For most workflows, running the MCP server is the recommended approach.

## Contributing

### Commit messages

This project follows **conventional commits**:

```
feat:     New feature
fix:      Bug fix
docs:     Documentation only
test:     Adding or updating tests
refactor: Code restructuring without behavior change
chore:    Build, CI, or tooling changes
```

Examples:

```
feat: add MySQL driver with utf8mb4 support
fix: correct heatmap axis mapping for weekday ordering
refactor: extract driver pattern from database_manager
test: add coverage for fan-trap detection edge cases
docs: update configuration reference for BigQuery
```

### Before submitting changes

1. **Run the test suite** and confirm no regressions:

   ```bash
   uv run pytest
   ```

2. **Format and lint** your code:

   ```bash
   black src/ tests/ server.py
   isort src/ tests/ server.py
   ruff check src/ tests/ server.py
   mypy src/
   ```

   Or run all checks at once:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

3. **Add tests** for new functionality. Place test files in `tests/` following the `test_*.py` naming convention. Use `pytest-asyncio` for async tests (auto mode is configured).

4. **Type-annotate** all public functions. The project enforces strict mypy settings including `disallow_untyped_defs` and `disallow_incomplete_defs`.

5. **Consider database-specific behavior** when modifying schema analysis or query logic. Each database has different case sensitivity rules, query syntax, constraint models, and caching behavior. See the driver pattern section above.

6. **Run security scanning** for changes touching SQL handling or credentials:

   ```bash
   bandit -r src/
   ```

7. **Verify action pins** if you touched anything under `.github/workflows/`:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/check-action-pins.sh
   ```

   The `pins` job in CI runs the same check and blocks the merge.

### Code standards

- **Line length**: 88 characters (black)
- **Type hints**: Required for all public functions
- **Docstrings**: Google-style
- **Imports**: Sorted by isort with black-compatible profile
- **Async**: Use `async def` for MCP tool handlers; pytest uses `asyncio_mode = "auto"`
