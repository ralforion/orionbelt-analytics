# Fan-Trap Prevention

Fan-traps are one of the most common causes of silently incorrect SQL results. They inflate aggregated values without raising errors, making them particularly dangerous in analytical queries. OrionBelt Analytics detects fan-trap risks automatically at multiple stages -- during schema analysis, query validation, and GraphRAG context retrieval.

## What Is a Fan-Trap?

A fan-trap occurs when a query joins a parent table to two or more child tables through one-to-many relationships and then applies aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG). The multiple one-to-many joins create a Cartesian product between the child tables, multiplying rows before the aggregation runs.

Consider an `orders` table with two child tables:

```
orders (1) ---> order_items (many)
orders (1) ---> shipments   (many)
```

If order #100 has 3 items and 2 shipments, joining all three tables produces 6 rows for that order (3 x 2). Any SUM on `order_items.amount` is now tripled by the shipment rows, and any COUNT on shipments is tripled by the item rows.

### A Concrete Example

Suppose the data looks like this:

| order_id | item_amount |
|----------|-------------|
| 100      | 50          |
| 100      | 30          |
| 100      | 20          |

| order_id | shipment_id |
|----------|-------------|
| 100      | S1          |
| 100      | S2          |

The correct total for order #100 is 100 (50 + 30 + 20). But a naive join produces:

```sql
SELECT o.id, SUM(oi.item_amount) AS total
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
JOIN shipments s ON o.id = s.order_id
GROUP BY o.id;
```

Result: **200** (each item row is duplicated per shipment). The query executes without errors, returns a plausible-looking number, and silently corrupts every downstream report that uses it.

## How OrionBelt Detects Fan-Traps

OrionBelt Analytics applies fan-trap detection at three layers, each catching different scenarios.

### Layer 1: Schema Analysis (`discover_schema`)

When `discover_schema()` inspects foreign keys, it flags any table that references multiple other tables as a potential fan-trap bridge:

```python
# From src/handlers/schema.py
if len(table_info.foreign_keys) > 1:
    fan_trap_warnings.append({
        "table": table_name,
        "warning": f"Table {table_name} connects to multiple tables "
                   "- potential fan-trap risk",
        "referenced_tables": referenced_tables,
        "recommendation": "Use separate CTEs or UNION approach "
                          "for multi-fact aggregations",
    })
```

These warnings appear in the `discover_schema()` output so the LLM (or user) is aware of risky join paths before writing any SQL.

### Layer 2: OBQC Query Validation (built into `execute_sql_query`)

The Ontology Basic Quality Criteria (OBQC) validator runs automatically inside `execute_sql_query` before the query is run. It parses SQL queries using sqlglot and checks them against the ontology's relationship metadata. It counts how many one-to-many joins a query traverses. If two or more one-to-many joins co-occur with aggregation functions, the validator flags the query:

```python
# From src/obqc_validator.py
if one_to_many_count >= 2:
    result.fan_trap_risk = True
    result.issues.append(OBQCIssue(
        issue_type=OBQCIssueType.FAN_TRAP_DETECTED,
        severity=OBQCSeverity.WARNING,
        message=f"Potential fan-trap: {one_to_many_count} "
                "one-to-many joins with aggregation",
        suggestion="Use UNION ALL pattern for separate aggregations "
                   "per fact table, or use CTEs to pre-aggregate "
                   "before joining",
    ))
```

The validator knows which relationships are one-to-many because the ontology stores `oba:relationshipType` annotations on every OWL ObjectProperty.

### Layer 3: GraphRAG Context Retrieval

When GraphRAG retrieves context for a natural-language question, it examines the graph structure to detect tables with multiple outgoing foreign keys:

```python
# From src/graphrag/retriever.py
outgoing_fks = list(self.graph.successors(table))
if len(outgoing_fks) > 1:
    warnings.append({
        "bridge_table": table,
        "referenced_tables": outgoing_fks,
        "warning": f"Table '{table}' connects to multiple tables "
                   "- potential fan-trap",
        "recommendation": "Use separate CTEs or UNION approach "
                          "if aggregating across these relationships"
    })
```

These warnings are included in the GraphRAG context returned to the LLM, guiding it to generate safe SQL patterns.

## Dangerous SQL Patterns

The following patterns are common sources of fan-trap errors. All of them join a parent table to multiple child tables and then aggregate.

### Direct Multi-Child Join with SUM

```sql
-- DANGEROUS: inflates both SUM and COUNT
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    SUM(s.amount) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(sh.shipment_id) AS shipment_count
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN sales s ON c.id = s.customer_id
LEFT JOIN shipments sh ON c.id = sh.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name;
```

If a customer has 5 sales and 3 shipments, each sale row appears 3 times (once per shipment). `total_sales` is tripled; `shipment_count` is quintupled.

### Chain Join Through a Bridge Table

```sql
-- DANGEROUS: orders is the bridge between order_items and shipments
SELECT
    o.id AS order_id,
    SUM(oi.amount) AS item_total,
    SUM(sh.shipping_cost) AS shipping_total
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
JOIN shipments sh ON o.id = sh.order_id
GROUP BY o.id;
```

### Aggregation After Multiple LEFT JOINs

```sql
-- DANGEROUS: two 1:many LEFT JOINs from the same parent
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating,
    SUM(s.quantity) AS total_sold
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.product_id
LEFT JOIN sale_items s ON p.id = s.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;
```

Products with many reviews and many sales will have heavily inflated results for both measures.

## Safe SQL Patterns

### Pattern 1: UNION ALL (Recommended)

Combine fact tables vertically before aggregating. This eliminates the Cartesian product entirely because each fact type contributes its own rows independently.

```sql
WITH unified_facts AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        amount AS measure_value,
        'sale' AS fact_type
    FROM sales

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        customer_id,
        return_amount AS measure_value,
        'return' AS fact_type
    FROM returns
)
SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN fact_type = 'sale' THEN measure_value ELSE 0 END) AS total_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN fact_type = 'return' THEN measure_value ELSE 0 END) AS total_returns
FROM unified_facts
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

When the measures share the same unit (e.g., monetary amounts), a simpler variant works:

```sql
WITH unified_facts AS (
    SELECT customer_id, sales_amount, 0 AS returns
    FROM sales
    UNION ALL
    SELECT customer_id, 0, return_amount
    FROM returns
)
SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
    SUM(returns) AS total_returns
FROM unified_facts
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### Pattern 2: Separate Aggregation with CTEs

Pre-aggregate each fact table independently, then join the results. Since each CTE produces one row per key, the final join is one-to-one and safe.

```sql
WITH sales_totals AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        SUM(amount) AS total_sales,
        COUNT(*) AS sale_count
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
shipment_totals AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) AS shipment_count,
        SUM(shipping_cost) AS total_shipping
    FROM shipments
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT
    s.customer_id,
    s.total_sales,
    s.sale_count,
    COALESCE(sh.shipment_count, 0) AS shipment_count,
    COALESCE(sh.total_shipping, 0) AS total_shipping
FROM sales_totals s
LEFT JOIN shipment_totals sh ON s.customer_id = sh.customer_id;
```

### Pattern 3: Correlated Subqueries

Use scalar subqueries to fetch aggregated values from each child table without joining them together.

```sql
SELECT
    o.id AS order_id,
    o.order_date,
    (SELECT SUM(oi.amount) FROM order_items oi WHERE oi.order_id = o.id) AS item_total,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shipments sh WHERE sh.order_id = o.id) AS shipment_count
FROM orders o;
```

This approach is clear and correct, though it may be less efficient than CTEs on large datasets.

### Pattern 4: Window Functions with Pre-Aggregation

When you need to preserve row-level granularity alongside aggregated values, pre-aggregate the "many" side in a subquery:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    o.id AS order_id,
    SUM(oi.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY o.id) AS item_total,
    sh_agg.shipment_count
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT order_id, COUNT(*) AS shipment_count
    FROM shipments
    GROUP BY order_id
) sh_agg ON o.id = sh_agg.order_id;
```

The shipments are pre-aggregated in the subquery, so joining them back to orders does not multiply the order_items rows.

## How Ontology Annotations Help

OrionBelt generates an OWL ontology where each foreign key relationship is stored as an `owl:ObjectProperty` with custom `oba:` (OrionBelt Analytics) namespace annotations:

- **`oba:relationshipType`** -- Records whether the relationship is `"one_to_many"` or `"many_to_one"`. This is the primary signal used by the OBQC validator to count how many one-to-many joins a query traverses.

- **`oba:sqlJoinCondition`** -- Stores the exact SQL join condition (e.g., `orders.id = order_items.order_id`). This ensures the LLM generates correct join predicates and does not invent invalid join paths.

- **Inverse relationships** -- Every foreign key generates both the forward (`many_to_one`) and inverse (`one_to_many`) OWL properties, linked via `owl:inverseOf`. This gives the validator and the LLM a complete picture of directionality.

Together, these annotations let the OBQC validator make a deterministic decision: if a query joins two or more tables that sit on the "many" side of one-to-many relationships and applies aggregation, it is a fan-trap candidate.

### Example Ontology Fragment (Turtle)

```turtle
:orders_has_order_items a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :Orders ;
    rdfs:range :OrderItems ;
    oba:relationshipType "one_to_many" ;
    oba:sqlJoinCondition "orders.id = order_items.order_id" ;
    owl:inverseOf :order_items_belongs_to_orders .

:orders_has_shipments a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :Orders ;
    rdfs:range :Shipments ;
    oba:relationshipType "one_to_many" ;
    oba:sqlJoinCondition "orders.id = shipments.order_id" ;
    owl:inverseOf :shipments_belongs_to_orders .
```

When the OBQC validator sees a query joining `orders`, `order_items`, and `shipments` with `SUM()`, it looks up both ObjectProperties, finds two `one_to_many` relationships, and raises the `FAN_TRAP_DETECTED` warning.

## Result Validation Checklist

Even with automatic detection, verify your results:

1. **Compare against source tables.** Run `SELECT SUM(amount) FROM order_items` independently and compare to your joined query.

2. **Check row counts.** If `orders` has 1,000 rows but your join produces 50,000, something is being multiplied.

3. **Rely on `execute_sql_query`'s built-in checks.** It runs OBQC validation before executing and will flag fan-trap risks (or reject the query) in the response.

4. **Review the `fan_trap_warnings` from `discover_schema()`.** They list which tables have multiple foreign keys and are therefore fan-trap candidates.

5. **Look at business expectations.** If a customer's total suddenly jumps by an order of magnitude after adding a second join, investigate.

## Quick Reference

| Scenario | Risk Level | Recommended Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Single fact table, one join | None | Direct aggregation |
| Two tables, 1:1 relationship | None | Direct join |
| Parent + one child (1:many) | Low | Direct join (single child is safe) |
| Parent + two children (1:many each) | **High** | UNION ALL or separate CTEs |
| Bridge table connecting multiple tables | **High** | Pre-aggregate before joining |
| Multiple fact tables, same measure type | **High** | UNION ALL |
| Multiple fact tables, different measures | **High** | Separate CTE aggregation |

## Workflow Summary

```
1. connect_database()
2. discover_schema()        --> fan_trap_warnings in output
3. generate_ontology()     --> oba:relationshipType annotations stored
4. execute_sql_query()     --> OBQC fan-trap checks run automatically, then query executes
```

When in doubt, use UNION ALL or separate aggregation CTEs. Fan-traps cause silent data corruption -- queries succeed but return wrong numbers.
