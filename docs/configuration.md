# Configuration Reference

This document provides the full configuration reference for OrionBelt® Analytics, covering all environment variables, transport modes, and per-database troubleshooting guidance.

## Environment Variables

OrionBelt Analytics is configured via a `.env` file in the project root. Copy the template to get started:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

All database parameters are optional when calling `connect_database` -- the server falls back to `.env` values when tool parameters are not provided.

# Server Configuration
# -------------------
# Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

# Automatic Infrastructure Management
# --------------------------------------
# Phase 1: Auto-initialize GraphRAG in background when schema is analyzed
# Set to false to disable automatic initialization
AUTO_GRAPHRAG=true

# Embedding backend for GraphRAG semantic schema search (minilm | tfidf)
GRAPHRAG_EMBEDDING_MODEL=minilm

# Phase 2: Auto-generate ontology in background after GraphRAG completes
# Conservative default (false) - enable after testing
# When enabled: ontology is automatically generated and stored in Oxigraph RDF store
AUTO_ONTOLOGY=false

# Superseded artifact pruning
# Artifact filenames carry a timestamp, so every generate_ontology /
# discover_schema writes a NEW file while metadata records only the latest.
# This is how many generations of each artifact (per connection, per schema)
# to keep; older ones are deleted as soon as a new one is written. Minimum 1
# -- the file currently referenced is never a deletion candidate.
ARTIFACT_KEEP_VERSIONS=3

# Startup Workspace Cleanup
# -------------------------
# Runs on every startup regardless of the setting below:
#   - stale loose files directly under the output dir are deleted
#   - each workspace's charts/ directory is deleted (chart images are ephemeral)
#
# AUTO_CLEANUP_ON_STARTUP then controls whether whole workspaces are deleted.
# See "Startup workspace cleanup" below for the exact semantics.
AUTO_CLEANUP_ON_STARTUP=false

# Age threshold for AUTO_CLEANUP_ON_STARTUP=true, measured from the workspace's

# Semantic naming mode
# --------------------
# How suggest_semantic_names obtains rename suggestions for cryptic names:
#   auto            ask the client's model when it can be asked (default):
#                   the client must speak MCP 2026-07-28 and advertise
#                   sampling. Otherwise the review path.
#   input_required  the same, but warn in the log when the client cannot be
#                   asked.
#   review          never ask the client's model from the server. The client
#                   model reads the cryptic names and calls
#                   apply_semantic_names itself. Works with every client.
# ENABLE_SAMPLING is the deprecated predecessor: false maps to review.

### Embedding model

`GRAPHRAG_EMBEDDING_MODEL` selects how GraphRAG turns schema elements into vectors for semantic search (`search_schema`). The two backends behave very differently.

| | `minilm` (default) | `tfidf` |
|---|---|---|
| Method | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence embeddings via the ONNX runtime bundled with ChromaDB | Bag-of-words term frequencies |
| Matches synonyms | Yes | **No** |
| First-use cost | Downloads ~79 MB to `~/.cache/chroma` (~168 MB unpacked), then fully local | None |
| Network required | Only on first use | Never |

**Why the default matters.** TF-IDF only matches words that literally appear in your schema. Asking *"which products are most profitable and get returned the most"* against columns named `salesamount`, `unitcost` and `returnquantity` produces a query vector of all zeros -- `products` does not match `product` (no stemming), `returned` does not match `returns`, and `profitable` appears nowhere. Every element then scores 0.0, and the ranking degenerates to **index insertion order**: the results look like plausible schema elements but are simply the first rows in the index. `minilm` scores the same query on meaning and surfaces `productname`, `returnquantity` and `salesamount`.

Choose `tfidf` only for air-gapped installs or when the download is unacceptable, and expect intent-style questions to fail. If `minilm` cannot be loaded -- no network on first use, restricted cache directory -- the server logs a warning and falls back to `tfidf` rather than failing to start.

**Switching backends re-indexes.** Both backends emit 384-dimension vectors, so a stored index built by one loads without error into the other while being numerically meaningless. Vector stores therefore record which backend wrote them; on mismatch the index is discarded (JSON store) or the collection is dropped and recreated (ChromaDB), with a warning. Re-run `discover_schema()` to repopulate. Only the derived index is affected -- no ontology, RDF or user data is touched.

### Startup workspace cleanup

`AUTO_CLEANUP_ON_STARTUP` controls how much of the output directory survives a restart. It operates on **whole workspaces** -- one per database connection, under `OUTPUT_DIR/{connection_id}/` -- and honours a custom `OUTPUT_DIR`.

**Always runs, whatever the setting is:**

- stale loose files sitting directly in `OUTPUT_DIR` (not inside a connection directory) are deleted
- every workspace's `charts/` directory is deleted -- chart images are ephemeral and are regenerated on demand

Workspace data itself is only touched by the modes below.

| Mode | What is deleted |
|------|-----------------|
| `false` *(default)* | Nothing beyond the two steps above. Every workspace is kept, so auto-restore works after a restart. |
| `true` | A workspace is deleted if it has **no `metadata.json`** (orphaned directory), or if its recorded `workspace.updated_at` is older than `WORKSPACE_MAX_AGE_DAYS`. A workspace whose metadata exists but has no `updated_at` is **kept**. |
| `all` | Every workspace directory, unconditionally -- a full fresh start. |

**Deletion is all-or-nothing per connection.** Removing a workspace removes its schema cache, ontology TTL, R2RML mapping, saved semantic models, *and* the satellite stores held outside the workspace directory:

```
OUTPUT_DIR/{connection_id}/            # workspace: metadata.json, schema, ontology, models/
OUTPUT_DIR/chromadb/{connection_id}/   # GraphRAG vectors
OUTPUT_DIR/oxigraph/{connection_id}/   # RDF / SPARQL store
```

There is no partial or per-artifact cleanup. The `chromadb/` and `oxigraph/` parent directories are shared across connections and are never themselves treated as workspaces.

**Age comes from metadata, not the filesystem.** The `true` mode reads `workspace.updated_at` out of `metadata.json` rather than looking at file modification times, so touching files on disk does not keep a workspace alive.

### Per-version retention

Startup cleanup deletes whole workspaces; this deletes individual **versions** inside a workspace that is still in use.

Every `discover_schema` call opens a version for that schema, and `generate_ontology` and GraphRAG initialization fill in their halves as they complete. The result is a history under `schemas.{name}.versions` in `metadata.json` recording, per generation: the schema fingerprint and table/column counts, the ontology TTL file, its named graph and triple count, and the GraphRAG vector count and snapshot files. Opening a new version archives the one before it -- only the newest is `active`.

Retention applies to **archived** versions only, so the current generation is never a candidate:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GRAPHRAG_KEEP_VERSIONS` | `3` | Archived GraphRAG snapshots to keep per schema |
| `GRAPHRAG_MAX_AGE_DAYS` | `30` | Age past which an archived GraphRAG snapshot is eligible for deletion |
| `ONTOLOGY_KEEP_VERSIONS` | `5` | Archived ontology versions to keep per schema |
| `ONTOLOGY_MAX_AGE_DAYS` | `60` | Age past which an archived ontology version is eligible for deletion |

A version must exceed **both** the count and the age threshold to be deleted, and at least `min_versions` (2) are always kept regardless. These are read at cleanup time and override the copy recorded in `metadata.json`, so changing them takes effect on workspaces that already exist. Invalid or sub-1 values are logged and ignored rather than failing startup.

Cleanup is **manual**: call the `cleanup_old_versions` tool, which defaults to `dry_run=true` so you can see what would go before anything does. It reports the effective policy, what was (or would be) deleted, and the schema's remaining history.

Two deletions are deliberately guarded rather than unconditional:

- **Named graphs.** Successive generations of a schema reuse the same graph URI, so the graph is only dropped from Oxigraph when no surviving version still references it.
- **ChromaDB collections.** GraphRAG is connection-scoped and accumulative by design -- one collection holds every schema's vectors so cross-schema search and join discovery work -- so versions share a collection rather than each owning one. The collection is deleted only when no surviving version references it, which in practice means it stays as long as the schema has a live version. Per-version GraphRAG *files* are pruned normally.

Ontology, schema and R2RML **files** are additionally pruned by count as they are written, independently of this, via `ARTIFACT_KEEP_VERSIONS`.

### Security Notes

- **Master password**: Used to encrypt database credentials in memory via AES-128-CBC with HMAC. Creates a persistent salt file at `~/.mcp_credential_salt`. Without this setting, credentials are stored in plain text.
- **File permissions**: Restrict `.env` to owner-only access: `chmod 600 .env`
- **Version control**: Never commit `.env` -- add it to `.gitignore`.
- **Production**: Consider using environment variables directly, or a secrets management service (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault).
- **Credential rotation**: Implement rotation policies for database passwords and API tokens.

## Semantic Naming Mode

`SEMANTIC_NAMING_MODE` (default `auto`) controls how `suggest_semantic_names` obtains rename suggestions for cryptic identifiers.

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `auto` | Ask the client's model when it can be asked, otherwise the review path. |
| `input_required` | The same, but the server logs a warning when the client cannot be asked, so a deployment that expects pre-filled suggestions notices. |
| `review` | The server never asks the client's model. The host LLM inspects the cryptic lists and calls `apply_semantic_names` with its own suggestions. Works with every client in every protocol era. |

**How the client's model is asked.** By the era of the request, not by the mode:

- **MCP 2026-07-28** — a multi round-trip request (SEP-2322): `suggest_semantic_names` returns the sampling request instead of a result, the client fulfils it with its own model and calls the tool again, and the second round returns the usual response with a `suggestions` field. This replaced `ctx.sample`, which FastMCP 4 removed.
- **2025-11-25 and earlier** — over the connection the handshake era still has. `ctx.sample` is gone, but the session call beneath it is deprecated rather than removed, so these clients keep the same one-call flow. The SDK's per-call deprecation warning is filtered, since it names a decision an operator cannot act on.

Either way the response is identical, and the server logs which path a request took.

**Which clients can be asked.** One thing only: the client has to advertise the **sampling capability**, i.e. offer a model. A modern client without one would fail after the first round, on its own side, where the server can no longer fall back; a handshake-era client without one refuses the request outright. Both get the review path instead, with an unchanged response shape.

**This path is on borrowed time.** MCP deprecated Sampling itself in the 2026-07-28 revision, with removal no sooner than twelve months out. When it goes, the handshake half of this goes with it and the review path is what remains.

**Why a mode and not a switch.** MCP deprecated Sampling in its 2026-07-28 revision, also when carried by a multi round-trip request. The paths sit behind one seam in the handler so the path can change with the protocol while the tool's response shape stays the same. The review path is the durable one.

**`ENABLE_SAMPLING` is deprecated.** It is still honoured when `SEMANTIC_NAMING_MODE` is unset: `false` maps to `review`, and the server logs a deprecation warning at startup.

**Client compatibility:**

| Client | Can be asked | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| A client on MCP 2026-07-28 with a sampling handler | Yes | Asked through a multi round-trip request; `suggestions` is populated |
| OrionBelt Chat on MCP SDK 1.x (protocol 2025-11-25) | Yes | Asked over its connection; `suggestions` is populated, no upgrade needed |
| Claude Desktop, Claude Code | No | They advertise no model; review path |
| Generic pydantic-ai clients | With `sampling_model=` / `sampling_handler=` on the toolset | Otherwise review path |

**Disabling:** set `SEMANTIC_NAMING_MODE=review` to force the review path even when the client supports sampling. Useful for cost control, deterministic regression testing, or when a particular host LLM produces poor rename suggestions.

**Logging:** look for lines starting with `MCP sampling:` in the server log to verify the path a request took: one when the request is handed to the client (with the item count) and one when the answer is parsed (with the suggestion counts and the model name). The two rounds are separate requests, so no elapsed time is logged. When the review path is chosen instead, a line says why: `Client cannot answer a sampling request; using the review path`, or a warning if `SEMANTIC_NAMING_MODE=input_required` asked for more than the client can do.

---

## Transport Configuration

The server supports two MCP transport modes, configured via `MCP_TRANSPORT`:

### `http` (default, recommended)

Streamable HTTP transport for modern MCP clients. This is the standard transport for FastMCP servers and provides better performance and reliability.

```env
MCP_TRANSPORT=http
MCP_SERVER_HOST=localhost
MCP_SERVER_PORT=9000
```

**Claude Desktop** configuration (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "OrionBelt-Analytics": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:9000/mcp",
        "--transport",
        "http-only"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### `sse` (deprecated)

> **Deprecated.** The MCP specification deprecated the HTTP+SSE transport in
> its 2026-07-28 revision, and the server logs a warning at startup when this
> mode is selected. It will be removed in a future release. Use `http`.

Server-Sent Events transport for backward compatibility with older MCP clients. Use this mode for LibreChat integration or other clients that do not support streamable HTTP.

```env
MCP_TRANSPORT=sse
MCP_SERVER_HOST=localhost
MCP_SERVER_PORT=9000
```

**LibreChat** configuration (`librechat.yaml`):

```yaml
mcpServers:
  OrionBelt-Analytics:
    url: "http://host.docker.internal:9000/sse"
    timeout: 60000
    startup: true
```

**Note:** LibreChat requires SSE transport. Set `MCP_TRANSPORT=sse` before starting the server when using LibreChat.

### Transport Validation

The server automatically validates the `MCP_TRANSPORT` value on startup. If an invalid value is provided, it defaults to `http` and logs a warning.

---

## Troubleshooting

### PostgreSQL

- **Connection refused**: Verify the PostgreSQL server is running and accepting connections on the configured host and port.
- **Authentication failure**: Check that `POSTGRES_USERNAME` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` are correct and the user has `CONNECT` privilege on the target database.
- **Database does not exist**: Ensure `POSTGRES_DATABASE` refers to an existing database. Create it with `CREATE DATABASE mydb;` if needed.
- **SSL issues**: If the server requires SSL, make sure your connection string or driver configuration includes the appropriate SSL mode.
- **Firewall / network**: Confirm that the PostgreSQL port (default 5432) is open and reachable from the machine running OrionBelt Analytics.

### Snowflake

- **Account format**: The `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` value must match the account identifier shown in your Snowflake web UI URL. Common formats include:
  - `CLYKFLK-KA74251` (org-account)
  - `account.region` (e.g., `xy12345.us-east-1`)
  - `account.region.cloud` (e.g., `xy12345.us-east-1.aws`)
- **Role permissions**: Ensure your user has access to the specified `SNOWFLAKE_ROLE`. The role must have the necessary grants on the warehouse, database, and schema.
- **Warehouse**: The warehouse specified by `SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE` must be running (not suspended) and accessible to the configured role.
- **Case sensitivity**: Snowflake uses UPPERCASE identifiers by default. Database, schema, and table names in `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE` and `SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA` should typically be uppercase unless they were created with double-quoted lowercase names.

### BigQuery

- **Authentication**: BigQuery requires a service account JSON key file. Set `BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS_PATH` to the absolute path of the key file, or set the standard `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable instead.
- **Project ID**: Find your project ID in the GCP Console under project settings. Set it via `BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID`.
- **Dataset access**: The `BIGQUERY_DATASET` is optional and can be specified per query. When set, it limits schema analysis to that dataset.
- **Permissions**: Ensure the service account has at least the `BigQuery Data Viewer` role (`roles/bigquery.dataViewer`) for read access, and `BigQuery Job User` (`roles/bigquery.jobUser`) to run queries.
- **Billing**: BigQuery queries incur costs. Verify that billing is enabled on the GCP project.

### DuckDB / MotherDuck

- **Local file**: Use an absolute path for `DUCKDB_DATABASE_PATH` (e.g., `/data/analytics.db`). Use `:memory:` for a transient in-memory database.
- **MotherDuck cloud**: Prefix the database name with `md:` (e.g., `DUCKDB_DATABASE_PATH=md:my_database`) and provide your token via `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN`.
- **Token**: Obtain your MotherDuck access token from the MotherDuck web UI under Settings > Access Tokens.
- **File locking**: DuckDB uses file-level locking. Only one process can write to a database file at a time. If you see lock errors, close other connections first.
- **Read-only mode**: Pass `read_only=true` when connecting if you only need to query data and want to avoid lock contention.

### Databricks SQL

- **Server hostname**: Use the workspace URL without the `https://` prefix (e.g., `your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com`). Find this in the Databricks workspace settings.
- **HTTP path**: Copy from the SQL Warehouse connection details page in the Databricks UI (e.g., `/sql/1.0/warehouses/your_warehouse_id`).
- **Access token**: Generate a personal access token in User Settings > Developer > Access Tokens. Tokens can be scoped to specific permissions.
- **Unity Catalog**: Set `DATABRICKS_CATALOG` to the Unity Catalog name (e.g., `main`). For legacy Hive metastore, use `hive_metastore`.
- **Schema**: Set `DATABRICKS_SCHEMA` to the target schema (default: `default`).
- **Warehouse state**: The SQL Warehouse must be running. Serverless warehouses start automatically; classic warehouses may need manual start.

### MySQL

- **Connection refused**: Verify that MySQL is running (`sudo systemctl status mysql` or `brew services list`).
- **Access denied**: Check username, password, and user privileges. Grant access with `GRANT ALL ON mydb.* TO 'user'@'%';` and `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`.
- **Unknown database**: Ensure the database specified in `MYSQL_DATABASE` exists. Create it with `CREATE DATABASE mydb;`.
- **Character encoding**: Use `MYSQL_CHARSET=utf8mb4` (the default) for full Unicode support, including supplementary characters and emoji.
- **Connection timeouts**: Check firewall rules and network connectivity. For remote servers, confirm the MySQL `bind-address` allows external connections.
- **Too many connections**: Increase `max_connections` in the MySQL configuration or reduce the connection pool size.

### ClickHouse

- **No foreign keys**: ClickHouse does not support foreign key constraints. OrionBelt Analytics uses the ClickHouse driver, which queries `system.*` tables for schema metadata and handles the absence of FKs gracefully.
- **PRIMARY KEY vs ORDER BY**: In ClickHouse, `PRIMARY KEY` defines a sparse index (not a uniqueness constraint) and `ORDER BY` defines the physical sort order on disk. These are fundamentally different from RDBMS semantics.
- **Protocol**: Set `CLICKHOUSE_PROTOCOL` to `http` (default, port 8123) or `native` (port 9000). The HTTP interface is recommended for most use cases.
- **Secure connections**: Set `CLICKHOUSE_SECURE=true` when connecting to ClickHouse Cloud or any TLS-enabled instance.
- **Default credentials**: ClickHouse ships with `CLICKHOUSE_USERNAME=default` and an empty password. For production, create a dedicated user with appropriate permissions.

### Dremio

- **Host**: Use the Dremio coordinator node hostname or IP address.
- **Port**: The default PostgreSQL wire protocol port for Dremio is `31010`.
- **Protocol**: Dremio uses the PostgreSQL wire protocol; no additional drivers are needed beyond the standard PostgreSQL connector.
- **SSL**: SSL is enabled by default. Disable with `ssl=False` in the `connect_database` call if your Dremio instance does not use TLS.
- **Permissions**: Ensure your Dremio user has access to the target spaces, folders, and datasets.
