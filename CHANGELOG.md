## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **A connection handle, so a client without a transport session can work.**
  MCP 2026-07-28 removed protocol-level sessions and tells servers with state
  to mint a handle and take it back as an ordinary tool argument.
  `connect_database` now returns one (`ob_k2m9qa`), and all 28 tools accept it
  as the optional `connection` argument. A call finds its session by the
  handle, else by the MCP transport session, else -- unless
  `SESSIONLESS_FALLBACK=none` -- as the only live session that was itself opened
  without a transport session (never one that belongs to a transport session;
  logged as a warning on first use; multi-user deployments should set `none`).
  A handle that names no live session is an error (`unknown_connection`) and
  never lands in another session. Each handle is a user session of its own,
  with its own current schema and ontology state; sessions on one database
  still share the connection, schema cache and GraphRAG index. Clients on
  protocol versions up to 2025-11-25 keep working unchanged and are told their
  handle once, by `connect_database`. The handle is an address, not
  authentication.
  A caller that cannot be placed gets a plain refusal: the two session errors
  cross the tool boundary as `ToolError`, so the message that says how to
  recover reaches the model verbatim, survives `mask_error_details`, and is
  logged without a stack trace.
  The sessionless era is recognised by the protocol revision of the request,
  not by a missing session ID: FastMCP 4 reports a `ctx.session_id` there too,
  a fresh one per request, which would otherwise open an empty session on
  every call.

### Changed
- **A request without an MCP session is refused, not pooled.** `get_session_id`
  used to fall back to a literal `"default_session"` (and before that to the
  session object's memory address). FastMCP 3 never takes that path inside a
  request, but the sessionless 2026-07-28 protocol era does: every such client
  would have shared one database manager, one ontology state and one GraphRAG
  manager. It now raises `SessionRequiredError` (`session_required`). First
  step of the stateless-protocol plan; a connection handle as a tool argument
  follows.
- **The database manager and schema cache are shared per connection.** They
  were owned per MCP session, although the manager connects with the server's
  own credentials and the cache is a set of facts about the database. A
  `ConnectionRuntime` per connection ID now holds both, and `ServerState` binds
  sessions to it: a second client on the same database joins a warm cache and
  an open connection instead of rebuilding them, and the manager is
  disconnected when the last session leaves. `connect_database` on a session
  that shares a runtime connects a fresh manager rather than reconnecting the
  shared one under the other sessions, and replaces the shared one only if it
  has lost its connection. Groundwork for clients without a transport session.
- **GraphRAG is shared per connection too; ontology state is not.** The
  GraphRAG manager, an index built from the schema, moved onto the same
  `ConnectionRuntime`. A GraphRAG initialisation keeps running when the session
  that started it closes while others still hold the runtime, and its result
  lands in the shared state; it is cancelled with the last holder. Ontology
  state stays per session on purpose: which ontology is active, a custom one
  from `load_my_ontology`, applied semantic names and the OBQC validator are a
  user's choices, and two people on one database may work with different
  ones. The current schema is per session as well.
- **Tools that rewrite shared state or the workspace are serialized per connection.**
  `discover_schema`, `generate_ontology`, `apply_semantic_names`,
  `load_my_ontology`, `reset_cache`, `cleanup_workspace`, `cleanup_old_versions`
  and the workspace restore inside `connect_database` hold the runtime's writer
  lock. Readers take no lock, and different databases do not wait for each
  other.
- **Progress messages go through one function.** All 64 `ctx.info` /
  `ctx.error` calls in the handlers now use `notify_client` in `src/utils.py`
  (the former `safe_ctx_info`, generalized). A notification that cannot be
  delivered, typically because the client already disconnected, no longer
  aborts the tool whose result was still on its way. It is also the single
  place to adapt when MCP Logging, deprecated in the 2026-07-28 revision, goes
  away. A test fails if a handler calls the context directly again.

- **`SEMANTIC_NAMING_MODE` replaces `ENABLE_SAMPLING`.** `suggest_semantic_names`
  now picks its source of rename suggestions through one seam with three
  strategies: client sampling (today's path), input-required (the multi
  round-trip replacement, which needs FastMCP 4 and until then falls back),
  and review (the client model proposes the names itself). Modes: `auto`
  (default, unchanged behaviour), `input_required`, `review`. A context that
  offers no `sample` at all, which is what FastMCP 4 looks like, lands on
  the review path cleanly. No change to the tool's response.

### Deprecated
- **`ENABLE_SAMPLING`.** Still honoured when `SEMANTIC_NAMING_MODE` is unset:
  `false` maps to `review` and logs a warning. MCP deprecated Sampling itself
  in its 2026-07-28 revision.
- **`MCP_TRANSPORT=sse`.** The MCP specification deprecated the HTTP+SSE
  transport in its 2026-07-28 revision. The server now logs a warning at
  startup when it is selected; it will be removed in a future release. Use
  `http` (streamable HTTP).

### Fixed
- **A connection id now identifies the database.** The fingerprint that names
  a connection's workspace read `database_type`, `host`, `port`, `database` and
  `schema`; no driver writes `database_type` (they write `type`), and the rest
  are absent from exactly the drivers that need something else. Two DuckDB
  files, two BigQuery datasets, two Dremio endpoints reached with a token, and
  PostgreSQL vs MySQL on one host and database all hashed to the same value.
  They shared a workspace, and — now that sessions share a connection runtime —
  the second connection was handed the first database's open manager, so its
  queries were answered by the wrong database. Every non-secret field the
  driver reports goes into the hash now. Credentials are excluded, so rotating
  a password keeps the workspace and no secret is hashed into a directory name.
  **Existing workspaces are renamed:** on the first `connect_database` after
  the upgrade, directories left under the previous id are adopted, provided the
  new id has none. Nothing is overwritten and nothing is deleted; the adoption
  is logged. A workspace is adopted only when the connection it records matches
  the database in hand: the id being replaced is the one that could not tell
  databases apart, so following it blindly would hand one database's ontologies
  to another and lose them for their owner. A workspace that records no
  connection is left where it is.
- **One session's discovery no longer redirects another's.** Sessions on the
  same database share the cached schema data, but `_last_analyzed_schema` — the
  default target of every tool called without an explicit `schema_name` — was
  shared with it. After A discovered `sales` and B discovered `hr`, A's next
  parameterless `generate_ontology()` targeted `hr`. The pointer is per session
  now; the cached data it points into stays shared. Discovering a schema that
  another session had already cached moves this session's pointer too: the
  client asked for that schema, whoever paid for the round trip.
- **Background initialisation stays with the database it was started for.**
  GraphRAG initialisation and `AUTO_ONTOLOGY` generation outlive the tool call
  that started them, and read the session lazily all the way through. A session
  that connected to another database meanwhile pointed them at the new
  database: the old database's index was installed as the new one's GraphRAG,
  its ontology loaded into the new database's RDF store and named as the
  session's ontology, and its metadata written into the wrong workspace. With
  GraphRAG shared per connection that would have reached every session on the
  new database. The work now takes its GraphRAG state and connection ID once,
  up front; the ontology task leaves a session that moved on alone, and still
  writes the file and metadata where they belong. A connection change also
  waits for the init tasks it cancels before the old RDF store is released.
- **A reconnecting client lost the RDF store.** The Oxigraph store was opened
  once per MCP session, but its RocksDB directory is per connection and takes
  exactly one handle. A new session on the same database (a chat client
  reconnecting, a second tab) could not open it while the previous session still
  held it, so `store_ontology_in_rdf`, `query_sparql` and every other
  store-backed tool failed with "Failed to initialize Oxigraph store" until
  that session was evicted, 30 minutes by default. `ServerState` now shares one
  handle per store directory across sessions and closes it when the last
  session lets go; `cleanup_workspace` detaches every session before deleting
  the directory and refuses to reopen it until the deletion has finished,
  so a concurrent session cannot get a handle whose files are being removed. `OxigraphStoreManager.close()` now actually releases the
  directory: pyoxigraph has no close(), so the LOCK was only freed when the
  manager happened to be garbage-collected.
- **Tool errors arrived as schema violations.** Six tools were declared to
  return a string while their handlers return an error dict on failure, so
  FastMCP published a string-only output schema and clients validating
  structured content rejected the error itself ("is not of type 'string'").
  The declarations now admit both, and `generate_chart` declares its image
  content list, which FastMCP cannot describe, so it publishes no output
  schema instead of rejecting image mode for lacking structured content.
  Affected: `connect_database`, `generate_ontology`, `apply_semantic_names`,
  `cleanup_workspace`, `store_ontology_in_rdf`, `add_rdf_knowledge`.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-08-31

No functional change — as with 2.0.2, not a line of `src/` differs, and the
tool surface stays at 28. This release ships the full dependency re-resolve
that 2.0.2 deliberately held back, so the Docker image is rebuilt on a current
tree rather than one carrying a year of drift.

### Changed
- **Full lockfile re-resolve.** 127 packages moved, ten left the tree, one
  arrived. Eighteen major-version jumps reach the production closure —
  `protobuf` 6 → 7, `rpds-py` 0.27 → 2026.6.3, `websockets` 15 → 17, `rich`
  14 → 15, `markdown-it-py` 3 → 4, `kubernetes` 35 → 36, `packaging` 25 → 26,
  `pycparser` 2 → 3, `simplejson` 3 → 4, `more-itertools` 10 → 11, `cachetools`
  6 → 7, `attrs` 25 → 26, `importlib-resources` 6 → 7, `rich-rst` 1 → 2, and
  the date-shaped `certifi`, `pytz`, `tzdata`, `pywin32`. Four more are
  development-only. Held back from 2.0.2 on purpose: a security fix that had to
  ship was not the place to also move 127 packages. (#125)
- **`zstd` 1.5.7.3 is gone**, which upstream had yanked as "buggy — not thread
  safe" and which `uv` warned about on every resolve. It left the tree as a
  consequence of the re-resolve rather than needing separate handling. (#125)

### Fixed
- **Three third-party licences were recorded incorrectly** and are now right.
  `cffi`, `greenlet` and `simplejson` have adopted PEP 639 licence expressions,
  and what they declare disagrees with what their previous classifiers implied.
  The notices generator failed closed on all three rather than guessing — the
  first time that gate has fired on real input — and each was resolved by
  reading the package's own shipped licence text: `cffi` MIT → **MIT-0** (its
  `LICENSE` reads "MIT No Attribution" and omits the attribution clause),
  `greenlet` MIT AND Python-2.0 → **MIT AND PSF-2.0** (`LICENSE.PSF` is the
  Python Software Foundation licence, covering the files derived from Stackless
  Python), and `simplejson` MIT → **MIT OR AFL-2.1** (dual-licensed, per
  `LICENSE.txt`). None is copyleft, so no new written notice is owed. (#125)

### Removed
- **`docutils` has left the dependency tree**, retiring the
  `LicenseRef-Docutils-Mixed` entry — one fewer bundled dependency with
  obligations beyond attribution. `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` now covers 190
  packages, down from 197. (#125)

## [2.0.2] - 2026-08-31

No functional change — not a line of `src/` differs from 2.0.1. This release
exists to get patched dependencies into the **Docker image**, which bundles the
whole production closure and is only ever built on a version tag. The PyPI
wheel is unaffected either way: it declares its dependencies rather than
bundling them, so an installer already resolves the fixed versions.

### Security
- **Nine transitive dependencies carrying published advisories were upgraded**:
  `pyjwt` 2.10.1 → 2.13.0, `urllib3` 2.5.0 → 2.7.0, `mcp` 1.26.0 → 1.29.1,
  `pyasn1` 0.6.3 → 0.6.4, plus `click`, `idna`, `msgpack`, `pygments` and
  `requests`. That takes the production tree from 26 advisories across ten
  packages to 4 across one. Deliberately targeted rather than a blanket
  re-resolve, which would have moved 144 packages across 23 major versions for
  no security benefit. (#113)
- **`chromadb` stays at 1.5.9**, which is the remaining 4. There is nowhere to
  go: all four of its open advisories (CVE-2026-45829, -45830, -45831, -45833)
  report no patched version, and 1.5.9 is the newest release published. None is
  reachable from here in any case — every one targets the ChromaDB *server's*
  HTTP API, while GraphRAG uses `PersistentClient` in embedded mode against a
  local file and never exposes that surface. Tracked for whenever upstream
  ships a fix. (#112)
- **Nine development-only dependencies with advisories were upgraded** in the
  same sweep: `virtualenv` 20.33.1 → 21.7.7, `setuptools` 80.9.0 → 84.0.0,
  `python-socketio` 5.13.0 → 5.16.4, `python-engineio` 4.12.2 → 4.14.0,
  `werkzeug` 3.1.1 → 3.1.8, `marshmallow` 4.0.1 → 4.3.1, `nltk` 3.10.0 →
  3.10.3, `flask` 3.1.2 → 3.1.3 and `brotli` 1.1.0 → 1.2.0 — all reached
  through `locust`, `safety` and `pre-commit`. None ships in the wheel or the
  image, and the production tree is byte-identical with and without them, so
  this changes nothing about the released artefacts; it clears the alert list
  and keeps the contributor toolchain clean. (#116, #118–#123)
- **Dependabot security updates and alerts are now enabled** on the repository.
  The weekly version updates already configured only bump dependencies declared
  in `pyproject.toml`, so every transitive package above — production and
  development alike — was invisible to them. Enabling it immediately surfaced
  the nine development advisories in this release, which had gone unreported.

With those two sweeps, the whole locked tree is free of known advisories apart
from the four unfixable `chromadb` ones.

### Changed
- **Every GitHub Action is pinned to a commit SHA** with a comment naming the
  exact patch release it was cut from, and every workflow now runs with a
  read-only token by default; the PyPI job keeps its `id-token: write` alone.
  `scripts/check-action-pins.sh` resolves each pinned tag upstream and fails
  when the commit it names is not the one pinned, which is what distinguishes a
  real version bump from a hash quietly swapped for one taken from a fork. It
  runs as a required `pins` check on every pull request and as the first step
  of both publishing workflows, before any other action can touch the
  workspace. Build-affecting only — nothing here changes the published
  artefacts. (#111)

## [2.0.1] - 2026-08-29

No functional change. This release exists so the published artefacts carry the
third-party attribution the Docker image owes, and to ship three weeks of
accumulated dependency updates.

### Added
- **Third-party attribution.** `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` indexes every bundled
  dependency with its SPDX licence, generated from the locked production tree
  by `scripts/gen-third-party-notices.py`. The Docker image bundles the whole
  production closure, so publishing it redistributes ~197 packages plus a
  Debian base and chromium, and the MIT/BSD/Apache-2.0 attribution clauses
  apply to it in a way they never did to the PyPI wheel, which only declares
  its dependencies. (#104)
- **Verbatim licence texts in the image** at `/app/licenses/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`,
  collected at build time from each package's own distribution, alongside the
  Debian copyright files already under `/usr/share/doc/`. Packages that ship no
  licence file of their own carry a notice naming their licence, upstream
  source and recorded attribution; a package covered by neither fails the
  build rather than being dropped silently. (#104)
- **Written notices for the four dependencies with obligations beyond
  attribution**: psycopg2's LGPL-3.0 source offer, the CC-BY-SA 4.0 data
  bundled in wordfreq (with the Google Books Ngrams and SUBTLEX credits it
  requires), the MPL-2.0 file-level copyleft in certifi/orjson/tqdm, and
  docutils' mixed per-file terms. (#104)
- **A CI gate** that fails on stale notices, a missing licence text, or a new
  copyleft dependency that nobody has read — the path such an obligation would
  realistically take into this repo, given how much of the dependency tree
  moves by automated bump. (#104)

### Changed
- The project licence is now declared per PEP 639 as the SPDX expression
  `BUSL-1.1`, replacing the deprecated (and now mutually exclusive) `License ::`
  classifier. The wheel carries `LICENSE` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` under
  `dist-info/licenses/`. No change to the licence itself. (#104)
- Dependency updates, including cryptography 49 → 50, fastmcp 3.4.7, and the
  python-minor-patch group. (#99, #100, #101, #102, #103)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-08

Database views become first-class, and the ontology learns which columns can
actually be aggregated. Both change what `execute_sql_query` accepts, hence the
major version — though the practical break is narrow, and one of the two
changes only ever *unblocks* queries. Tool surface unchanged at 28 tools.

Also fixes the **DuckDB driver, which could not connect at all** in 1.8.0.

### Breaking Changes
- **`SUM()` of a key or a non-numeric column is now rejected.** `SUM(order_id)`
  returns a number with no meaning, and OBQC previously allowed it. Queries
  that ran before and depended on this will now fail. Blocking is limited to
  classifications the ontology records as `structural` — certain by
  construction. Name-pattern classifications (e.g. `SUM(unit_price)`) attach as
  warnings and never block. (#96)
- **A view cannot be joined.** A view has already applied its own joins and
  grain and carries no key, no foreign keys and no declared cardinality, so a
  join to one cannot be validated — and an unvalidatable join between an
  aggregate view and a fact table is what silently multiplies rows. Note this
  breaks nothing that previously worked: before this release *every* view query
  was rejected outright, so the net effect is strictly more queries succeed.
  (#94)

### Added
- **Database views are discovered and indexed.** Every `information_schema`
  driver filtered discovery to `table_type = 'BASE TABLE'`, so views never
  reached the ontology — and OBQC blocks any table the ontology does not
  describe. Every query against a view failed with "Table 'v_x' not found in
  ontology", the same false-positive class fixed for catalog tables (#83) and
  CTEs (#87). Implemented for all eight drivers. (#94)
- **Views are searchable in GraphRAG** as their own element type, carrying the
  view body — analyst-authored SQL naming the measures and joins someone
  already validated. Measured on a sales schema, "which clients have the best
  profit margin" moved from an irrelevant top hit (`clients.name`, on a query
  vector with one non-zero dimension) to `v_profit_margin` at 0.605.
  `graphrag_search(element_type="view")` filters to them. (#94)
- **Views are modelled in the ontology as `oba:View`**, typed apart from
  `owl:Class`, with columns as `oba:ViewColumn` and provenance as
  `oba:derivedFrom`. The typing is load-bearing: every consumer that reads
  tables looks for `owl:Class` carrying `oba:tableName`, so a view modelled as
  an ordinary class would be picked up as a base table by each of them and
  would have to be excluded again, rule by rule. Distinct types make the
  separation structural. (#95)
- **View columns come from the database catalog**, not from parsing the view
  body. `information_schema` knows the output of `SELECT *` and of an explicit
  `CREATE VIEW v (a, b)` header; parsing gets the second wrong and abandons the
  first. OBQC can therefore column-check a `SELECT *` view, which it previously
  had to leave unchecked. (#95)
- **Per-column measure semantics** — `oba:measureType`
  (`additive`/`semi_additive`/`non_additive`/`attribute`), `oba:measureBasis`
  and `oba:measureReason`. Additivity is a property of a column, not of a
  table: a denormalized table holds additive measures beside dimension
  attributes, which no table-level role can express. Classified
  deterministically with **no LLM call** — structural facts first (a key is an
  identifier; a non-numeric column cannot be summed), then column-name
  patterns. A column matching neither is left unannotated rather than assumed
  additive. (#96)
- **`oba:tableType` accepts `"mixed"`** so a denormalized table can be labelled
  honestly. It remains advisory; what may be aggregated is decided per column.
  (#96)

### Fixed
- **The DuckDB driver could not connect at all.** `connect_args={"timeout":
  ...}` is a `TypeError` inside `duckdb.connect()`, which accepts only
  `(database, read_only, config)`, so `connect()` returned `False` for every
  path including `:memory:`. There were no DuckDB tests, which is why CI never
  saw it; this release adds eight running against a real in-process database.
  (#94)
- **The metadata cache served a previous connection's answers.** Cache keys are
  `operation:schema` with nothing identifying the connection, and while
  `disconnect()` cleared the cache, the eight `connect_*` paths did not.
  Connecting to a second database answered `get_tables("public")` from the
  first for the full 5-minute TTL. Not a views bug — `get_tables()` had the
  same hole since long before views existed. Driver assignment now routes
  through one place that invalidates. (#94)
- **A view listed itself among its own sources.** DuckDB returns the whole
  `CREATE VIEW` statement, whose target parses as an ordinary table. (#95)
- **View lineage ignored the SQL dialect.** sqlglot handles Snowflake
  semi-structured access, BigQuery structs and ClickHouse aggregates without
  complaint, and fails on a Snowflake body read as PostgreSQL — so the dialect,
  not the SQL, was the difference between lineage and silence. (#95)
- **ChromaDB statistics omitted element types.** The per-type breakdown
  hard-coded three types, silently dropping views and — since 1.8.0 —
  `semantic_context`. Now sourced from a single `ELEMENT_TYPES` tuple. (#94)
- OBQC no longer misreads a CTE that shadows a base table as that table when
  judging aggregation. (#96)
- Inferred foreign keys are recognised as identifiers. ClickHouse has no
  foreign keys at all and BigQuery and Dremio rarely declare them, so without
  this every key on those engines read as an unclassified numeric. (#96)
- Numeric SQL types are matched by token, not substring or word boundary. Both
  of those fail on real dialect spellings in opposite directions: `int` is a
  substring of `POINT`, while `INT64`, `UInt64` and `HUGEINT` contain no
  numeric word at all — the latter misreading every measure on four supported
  engines as an attribute. (#96)
- An **unrecognised** SQL type is now left unclassified rather than assumed
  non-numeric. Assuming made an unfamiliar type name a blocking error on a
  valid `SUM`, which no amount of further enumeration would have fixed. (#96)

### Internal
- Verified end-to-end against a real PostgreSQL 17 — view discovery through
  `pg_catalog.pg_views`, catalog columns through both `SELECT *` and an
  explicit column header, lineage, OBQC isolation and query execution.
  Previously only DuckDB had been exercised.
- `ontology/spec.md` documents the view and measure vocabularies (§6.7, §7.4–7.6),
  including that a column carrying no `oba:measureType` MUST NOT be read as
  additive.
- 907 tests, up from 795.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-05

Feature release centred on OBQC correctness and GraphRAG schema search. **OBQC
now blocks fan-traps instead of warning about them** — see Breaking Changes.
Six OBQC false positives that blocked valid SQL are fixed, schema search moved
from TF-IDF to semantic embeddings, and the per-version retention mechanism
records the data it was always meant to clean up. Tool surface grows from 26 to
28 tools (`add_semantic_context`, `cleanup_old_versions`).

### Breaking Changes
- **A detected fan-trap now fails the query.** `execute_sql_query` returns
  `success: false` with structured fan-trap data instead of executing and
  attaching a warning. Pass `allow_fan_out=true` to run one anyway. The single-
  child case was previously invisible entirely: the rule counted fan-out joins
  and said nothing below two, so `SUM(sales.amount)` across one 1:many join
  returned a silently multiplied total with zero warnings. (#88)

### Added
- **Semantic embeddings for GraphRAG schema search.** Schema elements were
  embedded with TF-IDF, which matches literal terms only — a query like "which
  products are most profitable and get returned the most" produced an all-zero
  vector (no stemming, `profitable` in no schema text), collapsing the ranking to
  index insertion order. Search now uses semantic embeddings, so questions match
  meaning rather than exact tokens. (#79)
- **`add_semantic_context(target, context)`** — clients can write business
  vocabulary into the semantic index for a table or column, so questions about
  "profit", "margin" or "churn" have something to land on when the real column is
  named `unitcost`. On a sales schema, the profit-margin query's top hit moved
  from `sales.unitcost` (0.261) to the annotated `sales.salesamount` (0.567).
  (#82)
- **Applied semantic names are indexed into GraphRAG.** `apply_semantic_names`
  wrote business vocabulary into the ontology and nowhere else, so the enrichment
  was invisible to search; each applied suggestion is now mirrored into the
  semantic index tagged `source="ontology"`. (#81)
- **Per-version retention now records versions.** `DataCleanupManager` had the
  cleanup half only — every reference to the version list was a read, so
  `get_versions_to_cleanup()` returned `[]` unconditionally and the mechanism
  provably did nothing. `discover_schema`, `generate_ontology` and GraphRAG init
  now open and fill in version records, opening a version archives its
  predecessor, and pre-existing workspaces are seeded rather than orphaned. Adds
  the `cleanup_old_versions` tool. (#73, closes #68)
- `docs/obqc-overview.md`, indexed from the README. (#86)

### Fixed
- **OBQC blocked database catalog queries.** Every referenced table had to be in
  the ontology, which describes user data only, so
  `SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables` failed with "Table 'tables'
  not found in ontology". The qualifier was being discarded by `_extract_tables`,
  so a catalog reference was indistinguishable from a user table even in
  principle; qualifiers are now kept and known catalog schemas exempted. (#83)
- **Six OBQC false positives that blocked valid SQL**: CTE names reported as
  missing tables; `ROLLUP`/`CUBE`/`GROUPING SETS` flagging every selected column
  as absent from the GROUP BY; `USING`/`NATURAL`/comma-joins reported as
  Cartesian products; window functions counted as grouping aggregates; and date
  literals warned as `date vs string` type mismatches. Alias-qualified columns
  were never resolved (a false *negative*). (#87)
- **SELECT aliases referenced from ORDER BY.** `SELECT SUM(total) AS revenue FROM
  orders ORDER BY revenue DESC` was rejected with "Column 'revenue' not found in
  any referenced table" — the most common analytical query shape could not run at
  all. Aliases used from `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` and `QUALIFY` now
  resolve. (#84)
- **Validation rules now apply per SELECT, not query-wide.** `parsed_tables`,
  `parsed_columns` and `has_aggregation` were flat query-wide state gathered with
  `find_all` over the whole tree, so a subquery poisoned the outer scope:
  `SELECT id FROM users WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM orders)` was rejected as
  a Cartesian product (two tables, zero joins in total). Present since the
  initial commit. (#86)
- **Fan-out judged per join direction.** The heuristic asked whether the joined
  table was on the "many" side of *any* relationship anywhere in the schema
  rather than of the join at hand, and counted relationships instead of joins —
  so a correct `sales → clients → countries` chain drew "2 one-to-many joins with
  aggregation". (#85)
- **SPARQL queries the union of named graphs by default.** Ontologies always load
  into a named graph, but all three pyoxigraph call sites left
  `use_default_graph_as_union` at `False`, so an unwrapped pattern matched the
  empty default graph — zero rows, no error, and the tool description and
  docstring both taught the failing shape. SELECT, ASK and CONSTRUCT now span
  every loaded schema. (#77)
- Tier B audit: error handling, async correctness and timestamp handling. (#67)

### Changed
- `fastmcp` bumped to 3.4.5 (lockfile only; the existing
  `fastmcp[apps]>=3.3.1,<3.5` constraint already permitted it). (#76)
- Dependency refresh across the `python-minor-patch` group. (#57, #59, #89)
- Removed the dead `MCP_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` setting. `server.py` wrote it into the
  environment and nothing — not fastmcp, mcp, uvicorn or starlette — ever read it
  back; the comment's "default 5" did not exist either (fastmcp hardcodes
  `timeout_graceful_shutdown=2`). Both `.env.template` and the docs presented it
  as a working knob. (#78)

### Internal
- Cleanup computes its survivor set once per run instead of per deletion
  candidate, dropping an O(candidates × schemas × versions) scan and removing an
  order dependency in the ChromaDB ownership guard. (#75)
- `test_evict_idle_sessions` had never executed — `TestServerState` was a plain
  `unittest.TestCase` holding an `async def`, so unittest discarded the coroutine
  and reported a pass. Switched to `IsolatedAsyncioTestCase`. (#74)
- Ruff modernization rules adopted with an explicit lint select; all findings
  fixed. (#65, #70)
- Dev dependencies migrated to PEP 735 dependency groups; black 26.5, pytest 9.x,
  isort 8.0.1, mypy 2.3.0, pre-commit 4.6.1; unused `testcontainers` dropped.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-07-15

Bug-fix release. Charting broke for anyone installing on pandas 3, which a fresh
install already resolves — the dependency floors are unbounded, so this affected
1.7.1 as published. No MCP tool surface changes (still 26 tools, same signatures).

### Fixed
- **Line-chart datetime axes lost `type="date"` under pandas 3.** The
  time-series axis enhancement was gated on a literal `datetime64[ns]` dtype;
  pandas 3 parses to `datetime64[us]`, so the check silently stopped matching and
  the axis rendered untyped — no error, just a wrong axis. Now matched with
  `pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype`, which is resolution-agnostic (and was
  already used for the same purpose elsewhere). (#54)

### Changed
- Allow `fastmcp[apps]` 3.4.x (`>=3.3.1,<3.5`). This is the only dependency
  constraint that moves for installers; the pandas/sqlglot/cryptography floors are
  unchanged. (#47)
- Docker image moves to **Python 3.14**. The base image tag is now the single
  source of truth for the image's interpreter (`UV_PYTHON` pinned to it), so a
  base bump can no longer leave uv building the virtualenv against a different
  Python. (#50)
- OBQC accepts sqlglot 30's `Expr`. `Expr` is a new base class of `Expression`
  and `parse_one` returns the wider type; the validator helpers now take
  `exp.Expr`. Types only — no behavior change. (#52)
- Dependency refresh: sqlglot 30.12.0, pandas 3.0.3, cryptography 49.0.0, plus 20
  minor/patch bumps. (#45, #49, #52, #55)

### Internal
- Dependabot now watches uv, GitHub Actions, and Docker. (#42)
- CI tests on both Python 3.13 and 3.14, covering the supported `requires-python`
  range rather than a single pinned version. (#50)
- Docker image changes are gated by a build **and smoke test** (venv interpreter
  resolves, `src.main` imports, server boots and serves) — the image previously
  was not built at all until a release tag, so a broken one surfaced as a failed
  publish. (#51, #53)

## [1.7.1] - 2026-06-26

Bug-fix release centered on the RDF/SPARQL store, which had broken against the
resolved pyoxigraph version. No MCP tool surface changes (still 26 tools, same
signatures).

### Fixed
- **RDF/SPARQL store repaired for pyoxigraph 0.5.x.** `query_sparql` (SELECT),
  `query_sparql_ask` (ASK), and `add_triple`/`add_knowledge` raised at runtime
  because they used 0.3.x APIs removed in the resolved 0.5.x. Migrated to `Quad`,
  `QuerySolutions.variables`, and `bool(QueryBoolean)`. (#39)
- **Ontology version cleanup now deletes RDF triples.** Added
  `OxigraphStoreManager.delete_graph()`; cleanup previously called a nonexistent
  method and left stale triples in the store. (#39)
- **Consistent RDF named-graph URIs.** Manual storage, auto-persistence,
  semantic-name persistence, and export/download now share a single
  `schema_graph_uri()` helper, so a manually stored ontology is no longer
  invisible to RDF export. (#39)
- **`query_sparql` timeout is now enforced (best-effort).** `timeout_seconds`
  previously had no effect; it now unblocks the caller when the timeout elapses
  (the underlying query may keep running, as pyoxigraph exposes no native
  cancellation). (#39)
- **Safe Oxigraph store open.** A locked store no longer has its RocksDB `LOCK`
  auto-deleted on open failure (which risked two-process corruption); the error
  propagates with recovery guidance. (#39)
- CONSTRUCT serialization uses `RdfFormat.TURTLE` instead of a deprecated MIME
  string. (#39)

### Changed
- Pinned `pyoxigraph>=0.5,<0.6` and upgraded to 0.5.9. (#39)
- `src/` now passes strict mypy; the mypy check is a blocking CI gate (was
  advisory). (#37)
- Author email updated to info@ralforion.com. (#33)

### Added
- Deterministic MCP tool-surface audit workflow (`mcp-xray`) in CI, rendering its
  report to the run summary. (#35, #36)
- Docker Hub badges and publish workflow. (#34)

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-22

Architecture-review release: correctness fixes, stronger SQL safety, and a large
internal refactor of the registration layer. No MCP tool surface changes (still
26 tools, same signatures).

### Added
- **Driver/dialect registry** (`src/drivers/registry.py`) — a single source of
  truth mapping each `db_type` to its driver class and sqlglot dialect.
  `SUPPORTED_DB_TYPES`, the driver classes, and OBQC's dialect map now all derive
  from `constants.DB_SQLGLOT_DIALECTS`, so they can no longer drift apart.
- **Parser-based SQL safety gate** (`security.analyze_sql_statement`) — sqlglot
  validation is now the primary read-only/single-statement check, run ahead of
  the regex first-filter.
- **Typed `HandlerContext`** — handlers receive one request-scoped services
  object instead of many helper keyword arguments.
- CI workflow enforcing ruff, black, isort and pytest (mypy advisory).

### Changed
- **OBQC dialect parity** — `bigquery`, `duckdb`, `databricks` and `mysql` are
  now validated with their own sqlglot dialect instead of silently falling back
  to the PostgreSQL dialect.
- SQL validation now catches write/DDL operations hidden after a CTE
  (`WITH x AS (...) INSERT ...`) and no longer mis-flags a semicolon inside a
  string literal (`WHERE name = 'a;b'`) as multiple statements.
- **Refactor (no behavior change):** split the 1,237-line `main.py` into
  `server_state.py`, `resources.py` and `tool_types.py`; decomposed the
  1,466-line `handlers/ontology.py` into focused
  generation/semantic/io/artifacts modules.
- Repository formatted with black + isort; tooling aligned to Python 3.13.

### Fixed
- **AUTO_ONTOLOGY** background generation called a non-existent generator method
  and silently produced nothing; it now generates the ontology correctly.
- Artifact downloads (`download_artifact`) honor an explicit `schema_name` and
  read that schema's per-schema state instead of the currently active schema.
- RDF-store auto-restore on `connect_database` no longer fails with an
  AttributeError on RDF-enabled workspaces.
- Startup banner reports the real registered tool count (was a stale `23`).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Graph reasoning surface over the generated ontology** (`design/PLAN_graph_reasoning.md`):
  - **`oba:joinsTo` shared join predicate.** Every declared or inferred many-to-one foreign key now also emits a single directed `oba:joinsTo` edge between the table classes (finer grain → coarser grain). A single SPARQL property path `?from oba:joinsTo+ ?to` answers directed reachability across all FKs without enumerating each per-FK object property. Declared in `ontology/oba.ttl` (vocabulary bumped 0.1 → 0.2).
  - **`reachable_from` MCP tool** — the dimension-capable tables for a query anchored on a table (many-to-one closure): coarser-grain tables joinable without row multiplication, safe to GROUP BY / filter on.
  - **`measurable_from` MCP tool** — the measure-capable tables (one-to-many closure, the inverse): finer-grain tables that fan out the anchor and must only be aggregated, never used as dimensions at this grain. Both closures are cycle-safe.
  - **`plan_composite_query` MCP tool** — advisory Composite Fact Layer (CFL) decomposition: detects whether the requested facts are independent grains (disjoint siblings) requiring a `UNION ALL` composite, and returns the leg roots, conformed (shared) GROUP BY dimensions, and per-leg NULL-pad sets. Advisory only — OBA does not compile SQL; defer compilation to OrionBelt Semantic Layer when connected.
  - **Optional in-process SHACL validation.** When `pyshacl` is installed, `generate_ontology` validates the generated ontology against `ontology/oba-shacl.ttl` and surfaces violations as a non-blocking warning (gated by `OBA_SHACL_VALIDATE`, default on). Gracefully no-ops when the dependency or shapes file is absent.

### Changed
- **OBQC fan-trap detection is now grounded in the ontology's own `owl:disjointWith` axioms** (sibling facts sharing a dimension) instead of only re-deriving the risk from the relationship heuristic. When disjoint facts appear together in an aggregating query, OBQC cites the actual disjoint tables and recommends a Composite Fact Layer (UNION ALL). The relationship heuristic is retained as a fallback when no disjointness axioms are present.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-06-10

### Changed
- **Constrained MCP tool string parameters at the input boundary.** Enumerated parameters now use `Literal` types (`db_type`, `cache_type`, `artifact_type`, `source`, `chart_type`, `chart_style`, `sort_order`, `output_format`, `element_type`), free-text and identifier parameters carry `max_length` bounds, and filename/model-name parameters reject path separators — so invalid, oversized, or path-traversing arguments are rejected before reaching a handler, and the constraints are published in each tool's JSON schema. Handlers keep their existing runtime validation as defense-in-depth. `save_semantic_model` additionally reduces `model_name` to a bare filename component so it can never escape the models directory.

### Fixed
- **Aligned all documentation with the registered tool set.** Removed references to four tools that were advertised but never registered (`validate_sql_syntax`, `download_ontology`, `list_tables_sparql`, `diagnose_connection_issue`) across the README, `docs/`, Claude skills, and all 8 integration guides, replacing them with registered equivalents (`execute_sql_query`'s built-in validation, `download_artifact`, `query_sparql`). Completed `docs/tools-reference.md` to cover all 23 tools (was 16). Corrected stale tool counts (README 32, startup banner 22 → 23).
- **Resolved all pre-existing lint findings** (ruff: unused imports, f-strings without placeholders, unused locals, redundant imports; intentional late imports annotated with `# noqa: E402`). `ruff check .` is now clean.

### Added
- `scripts/bump-version.sh` — bumps the version across all files, inserts a CHANGELOG stub, and runs `uv lock` in one step.
- `scripts/publish-docker.sh` accepts a generic `DOCKERHUB_PAT` (legacy `DOCKERHUB_RALFORION_PAT` still works).

## [1.5.2] - 2026-06-08

### Removed
- **`get_server_info` MCP tool** -- removed as redundant. Server metadata (name, version, supported databases, capabilities) is already provided via the MCP `initialize` handshake and the server `instructions`, and the live tool list via `tools/list`. The genuinely-unique capability descriptions were folded into the server instructions.

### Changed
- **Condensed server `instructions`** (~58 -> ~30 lines) -- dropped the duplicated database list and `Version:` footer (already supplied via `FastMCP(version=...)`), merged overlapping capability sections.
- **Slimmed `generate_chart`** from 13 to 11 parameters -- removed `width`/`height`. Interactive charts are responsive and size to their container; static PNG export now uses fixed 800x600 constants. Docstring condensed.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- **MCP handshake advertised the wrong version** -- `FastMCP()` was constructed without an explicit `version`, so the `initialize` response's `serverInfo.version` fell back to the FastMCP package version (e.g. `3.2.4`) instead of the application version. The constructor now receives `version=__version__`.

### Changed
- Upgraded `fastmcp[apps]` from `>=3.2.4` to `>=3.3.1,<3.4`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **MCP sampling for `suggest_semantic_names`** -- when the connected client advertises the sampling capability, the server now calls back through the host LLM via `ctx.sample()` to pre-fill rename suggestions for cryptic identifiers, returning a `suggestions` dict alongside the cryptic-name lists in a single tool call.
  - Gated on a new `ENABLE_SAMPLING` env flag (default `true`). Set to `false` to force the legacy manual-review path everywhere.
  - Clients without sampling support (e.g. Claude Desktop) silently fall back to the legacy response shape — no breaking change.
  - Sampling requests, results, and failures are logged with elapsed time and item counts for observability.

### Fixed
- **MCP session crash on client disconnect during `suggest_semantic_names`** -- a notification (`ctx.info`) write that hit `anyio.ClosedResourceError` because the client had already closed the streamable-HTTP session was caught by the handler's outer `except` and triggered a second doomed write, bringing down the entire FastMCP TaskGroup. Notifications are now sent through `safe_ctx_info` (failures swallowed at debug level), and `ClosedResourceError`-class disconnects re-raise cleanly so the framework tears the session down instead of writing into a dead transport.
- **Sampling response parsing** -- replaced pydantic-ai's `result_type=Dict[str, str]` (which forces the model to call an injected `final_response` tool, fragile on large responses) with explicit JSON parsing that accepts bare JSON, ```json fences, and prose-embedded JSON.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-05
