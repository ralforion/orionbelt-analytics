# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

OrionBelt Analytics is an MCP server (FastMCP) that analyzes relational database schemas, generates RDF/OWL ontologies with embedded SQL mappings, and provides relationship-aware Text-to-SQL with fan-trap prevention, GraphRAG schema discovery, SPARQL access, and Plotly charting. Python 3.13+, managed with `uv`.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync                                  # create venv + install all deps (prod + dev)
uv run server.py                         # start the MCP server (http://localhost:9000)

uv run pytest                            # full suite (coverage is on by default via addopts)
uv run pytest tests/test_obqc_validator.py -v          # single file
uv run pytest tests/test_obqc_validator.py::test_name -v   # single test
uv run pytest -k "ontology and not server"             # keyword expression

black src/ tests/ server.py && isort src/ tests/ server.py   # format
ruff check src/ tests/ server.py         # lint (server.py is the root entry point)
mypy src/                                # strict type check (disallow_untyped_defs etc.)
bandit -r src/                           # security scan (run for SQL/credential changes)
./scripts/audit-prod-deps.sh             # advisories in the shipped dep tree (CI job `deps`)
uv run python scripts/gen-third-party-notices.py   # refresh THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md after a dependency change
pre-commit run --all-files               # all of the above as configured hooks
```

Config comes from `.env` (copy from `.env.template`). At minimum set credentials for one database. Key vars: `MCP_TRANSPORT` (http/sse), `MCP_SERVER_PORT` (9000), `AUTO_GRAPHRAG`, `SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `AUTO_CLEANUP_ON_STARTUP`.

## Architecture

**Strict three-layer separation** — keep these boundaries when adding or changing tools:

1. **Registration** (`src/main.py`): thin `@mcp.tool()` async wrappers. Extract session state, delegate to a handler. No business logic here.
2. **Handlers** (`src/handlers/*.py`): tool implementation. Receive db manager / session data / config as parameters and orchestrate service modules. Grouped by domain (`connection`, `schema`, `ontology`, `query`, `chart`, `rdf`, `graphrag`, `workspace`).
3. **Service** (`src/database_manager.py`, `src/ontology_generator.py`, `src/security.py`, `src/oxigraph_store.py`, `src/obqc_validator.py`, …): pure domain logic with **no MCP dependencies** — independently testable and importable for batch use.

**Database drivers** (`src/drivers/`): `BaseDriver` (`base.py`) defines the abstract interface; one driver per dialect (postgresql, mysql, snowflake, clickhouse, dremio, bigquery, duckdb, databricks). Adding a database = implement `BaseDriver` + register in `database_manager.py`. Dialect quirks matter (e.g. Snowflake UPPERCASE/case-sensitive identifiers, ClickHouse has no FKs and uses `ORDER BY` as sort key) — account for case sensitivity, constraint models, and query syntax when touching schema or query logic.

**Per-session / per-schema state** (`src/session.py`): each MCP session owns a `SessionData`. Ontology state is isolated **per schema** (`SchemaState` → `OntologyState`), but **GraphRAG and the Oxigraph RDF store are connection-scoped and accumulative** — successive `discover_schema()` calls add tables to the *same* graph/vector store/named-graphs, so cross-schema join discovery and unified search work, and switching schemas does not destroy a prior schema's ontology. Idle sessions are auto-evicted. State that describes the *database* rather than the client lives on a `ConnectionRuntime`, one per connection ID, that `ServerState` binds sessions to: the database manager, the schema cache and GraphRAG. What a *user* is doing stays with the session: which schema is current, and the whole ontology state (active or custom-loaded ontology, applied semantic names, the OBQC validator built from it) -- two people on one database may work with different ontologies. Sessions on the same database share the runtime, so never clear or reconnect it in place on behalf of one session -- `connect_database` connects a fresh manager and `_clear_session_state` unbinds first -- and any tool that rewrites it, or the connection's workspace on disk, must hold the runtime's writer lock: in `main.py`, wrap the handler call in `async with _writer_lock(ctx):` as `discover_schema`, `generate_ontology`, `apply_semantic_names`, `load_my_ontology`, `reset_cache`, `cleanup_workspace` and `cleanup_old_versions` do. This is groundwork for clients without a transport session (MCP 2026-07-28).

**OBQC (Ontology-Based Query Check)** — the core differentiator. `src/obqc_validator.py` deterministically validates every SQL statement (parsed with `sqlglot`) against the loaded ontology: table/column existence, join validity, type compatibility, GROUP BY correctness, and **fan-trap detection** (aggregation across 1:many joins that silently multiplies rows). Runs inside `execute_sql_query` — **errors block execution, warnings attach to the response** for the LLM to self-correct. No LLM calls; fully deterministic.

**Ontology / RDF**: `ontology_generator.py` emits OWL where tables → classes and FKs → object properties, annotated in the `oba:` namespace (`oba:tableName`, `oba:primaryKey`, `oba:sqlJoinCondition`) so SQL is recoverable from the graph. `oxigraph_store.py` persists triples for SPARQL 1.1. The shipped vocabulary lives in `ontology/oba.ttl` + `ontology/oba-shacl.ttl` (force-included into the wheel; SHACL conformance via `src/shacl_validator.py`).

**GraphRAG** (`src/graphrag/`): `manager.py` orchestrates graph traversal (`retriever.py`, up to 12 hops), embeddings (`embedder.py`), community detection, and a ChromaDB vector store. Auto-initialized by `discover_schema()` when `AUTO_GRAPHRAG=true`.

**MCP resources**: skill files under `.claude/skills/` (fan-trap prevention, SQL best practices, chart examples, workflows) are exposed via `@mcp.resource()` in `main.py`.

`docs/development.md` has the full layout, design rationale, and contributing guide — read it for deeper context. Per-feature docs: `docs/obqc.md`, `docs/graphrag.md`, `docs/fan-trap-prevention.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/tools-reference.md`.

## Conventions

- **Conventional commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`).
- Changing the **production dependency set** means regenerating attribution:
  `uv run python scripts/gen-third-party-notices.py`. CI (`--check`) enforces it.
  Version bumps alone produce no diff by design; adding a package, or one under
  copyleft terms, does — and a new copyleft dependency fails the check until it
  has a written notice. See `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- Type hints required on all public functions (strict mypy); Google-style docstrings; 88-char lines; async handlers.
- Tests in `tests/` as `test_*.py`; `pytest-asyncio` in `auto` mode (no `@pytest.mark.asyncio` needed).
- Releases are **squash-only** (merge commits disabled). Tagging `v*.*.*` publishes
  both artefacts: `docker-publish.yml` builds the multi-arch image, and
  `pypi-publish.yml` builds, verifies and uploads the wheel. **The PyPI upload is
  irreversible** — a version can never be re-uploaded — so it is gated behind the
  `pypi` GitHub environment (Trusted Publishing, no stored token) and preceded by
  `twine check` plus assertions on tag/version agreement, licence metadata and the
  force-included ontology files. See
  `scripts/bump-version.sh` and the release-process note in memory before cutting
  a release.
