        The decision belongs to each *reference*, not to the name. A name can
        be a CTE in one scope and a real table in another, and neither reading
        may leak into the other:

        - Collecting names globally let a CTE hide a real table elsewhere in
          the query, so ``SELECT users.nonexistent FROM users WHERE EXISTS
          (WITH users AS (...) SELECT 1 FROM users)`` reported nothing.
        - Dropping the name from the exemption when it is used both ways fixed
          that but broke the other half: the inner CTE's own columns were then
          checked against the real table, and a valid query was blocked.

        So the exemption is recorded against the table node, and ``cte_names``
        stays purely informational.

        The single-child fan trap: ``FROM sales JOIN shipments ON
        shipments.sale_id = sales.id`` with ``SUM(sales.amount)`` returns a
        total inflated by every sale that shipped more than once, and an inner
        join silently drops the ones that never shipped. One fan-out join is
        enough to corrupt the number, so no count threshold applies.

        A measure taken from the *many* side is fine -- ``SUM(shipments.cost)``
        over the same join sums each shipment once -- so what matters is the
        direction between the measure's table and the one joined to it, not
        which table the query happened to put in FROM. ``FROM order_items JOIN
        orders`` summing ``orders.total`` inflates exactly as ``FROM orders
        JOIN order_items`` does: both produce one row per item. Each join is
        therefore judged from both ends.
