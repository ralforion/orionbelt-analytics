    """Flatten applied name suggestions into (target, context) pairs.

    The suggestions carry exactly what schema search lacks: the business word
    for an abbreviated identifier, and a sentence saying what it means. Applied
    to the ontology alone they never reach GraphRAG, whose vectors are built
    from raw schema metadata -- so a user asking in the enriched vocabulary
    still matches nothing.

    Takes what the generator *applied*, not what the caller requested. Those
    differ: apply_semantic_names skips any suggestion naming something the
    ontology does not contain, while the index accepts any target. Feeding it
    the request would let a typo -- ``table_name: "sale"`` for a column in
    ``sales`` -- create a searchable entry for a table that does not exist, and
    query generation would then be steered toward it.

    Targets are built from the raw SQL names the generator read back from the
    ontology, never from the suggestion's own identifiers. Suggestions are
    generated *from* the ontology, so they carry URI-safe names: a table called
    ``order-items`` appears as ``order_items``, which matches nothing in an
    index keyed by the real schema. An entry whose raw identity is unknown is
    skipped rather than guessed, for the same reason unmatched suggestions are.

    Args:
        applied_names: Output of
            :meth:`OntologyGenerator.applied_semantic_names` -- dicts with
            ``suggested_name``, ``description`` and the raw ``table_name``,
            ``column_name`` and ``related_table``. Loosely typed and
            defensively parsed: the values originate from an LLM payload, so a
            caller may hand over entries whose fields are not the strings the
            annotation promises.

    Returns:
        (target, context) pairs, where target is ``table``, ``table.column`` or
        ``from__to__to`` -- matching how GraphRAG identifies elements. Entries
        carrying no vocabulary, or no resolvable target, are skipped.

    The seam between the tool and whatever produces the names, so the path can
    change with the protocol without touching the tool:

    - ``INPUT_REQUIRED``: ask the client's model through a multi round-trip
      request (MCP 2026-07-28, SEP-2322). The tool returns the request instead
      of a result; the client fulfils it and calls the tool again with the
      answer. Replaces ``ctx.sample``, which FastMCP 4 removed in every
      protocol era.
    - ``SESSION_SAMPLING``: ask the client's model over the connection the
      handshake era still has. ``ctx.sample`` is gone, but the session call
      beneath it, ``ServerSession.create_message``, is deprecated rather than
      removed. This is what keeps a client on 2025-11-25 -- OrionBelt Chat
      today -- getting the same pre-filled suggestions from a FastMCP 4
      server. It goes when Sampling leaves the specification, and the
      multi round-trip half is what remains.
    - ``REVIEW``: no server-side suggestions. The client model reads the
      cryptic names and calls ``apply_semantic_names`` itself. Works with
      every client in every era, and is the durable path: MCP deprecated
      Sampling itself, also when carried by a multi round-trip request.
