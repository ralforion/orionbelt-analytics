"""Typed request-scoped services passed to handler functions.

Previously each tool wrapper in ``src/main.py`` threaded a handful of helper
callables into its handler as separate keyword arguments (``get_session_data``,
``create_error_response``, ``get_oxigraph_store``, ...). That made every wrapper
and every handler signature long and easy to get out of sync.

:class:`HandlerContext` bundles those services into one typed object. A wrapper
builds it once (capturing the current module-level helpers, so test patches on
``src.main`` / ``src.server_state`` are still honored) and passes ``services=``;
each handler reads what it needs as ``services.<name>``.

The callable fields are non-optional and default to :func:`_unset_service`, a
sentinel that raises if a handler reaches for a service its wrapper did not
provide. This keeps the fields statically callable (no ``Optional[Callable]``
"None not callable" noise) while still failing loudly on real misuse.
