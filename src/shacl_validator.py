"""Optional in-process SHACL validation of generated/loaded ontologies.

Validates an OBA ontology against the published shapes in
``ontology/oba-shacl.ttl`` using ``pyshacl``. Both the dependency and the shapes
file are treated as optional: if ``pyshacl`` is not installed or the shapes file
is not found, validation degrades to a no-op (``available=False``) instead of
raising. This keeps ontology generation/import working everywhere while enabling
real conformance checking wherever the pieces are present.
